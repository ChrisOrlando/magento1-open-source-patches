 This patch contains update for Magento to correctly recognize update BIN range of card numbers from Mastercard. It is applicable only to Magento versions prior to CE 1.9.3.0, and is already included in versions CE 1.9.3.0 and newer. For versions older than Magento CE 1.9.0.0, a previous patch for Discover changes (SUPEE-2725) need to be applied first.
